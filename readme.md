I wrote this to play with python, cherrypy, jinja2, ZODB, and whatever else I used.

Works easiest on ubuntu

Instructions:

1. `sudo apt-get install python-cherrypy3 python-jinja2 python-zodb`

2. in this directory, run ./hw.py

It will start its own server on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
